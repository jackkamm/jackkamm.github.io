I am a statistician and bioinformaticist at the [Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/). My current work is in genomic epidemiology, and involves phylogenetics, assembly, time series analysis, and Bayesian graphical models.
Previously, I have also worked in population genetics, coalescent theory, and ancient DNA. My Ph.D. advisor was [Yun Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) and postdoc advisor was [Richard Durbin](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/directory/richard-durbin).
