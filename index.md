### About me

I am a statistician and bioinformaticist at the [Chan-Zuckerberg
Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/). My current work is in infectious
disease research and surveillance, including genomic epidemiology,
microbial phylogenetics and genome assembly, metagenomics, and host
transcriptomics.  Previously, I have also worked in population
genetics, coalescent theory, ancient DNA, Bayesian graphical models,
and time series analysis.

#### A note on my name

My preferred name is "Jack", but my legal name is actually "John", and
in the past I have published some of my papers as "John A. Kamm".
