### John "Jack" Kamm, Ph.D.

I am a statistician and bioinformaticist. My original training was in
population genetics; I was advised by Yun Song for my Ph.D. and
Richard Durbin for my postdoc. Since then, I have worked in a range of
areas in statistical genetics, including metagenomics, pathogen
phylogenetics, and single cell RNAseq.
