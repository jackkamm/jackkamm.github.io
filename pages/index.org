* About me

I am a postdoc at the [[http://www.sanger.ac.uk/][Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]],
supervised by [[http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/durbin-richard][Richard Durbin]].
Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics
at UC Berkeley, supervised by [[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/][Yun S. Song]].

My research centers on the coalescent, a fundamental stochastic process for population genetics,
and involves both a probabilistic side, discovering new insights about the coalescent,
and a statistical side, using the coalescent to infer demographic history, recombination rates, and genealogies. 

More generally, I am interested in statistics, mathematics, and applications to genetics.
This includes topics such as graphical models, tensor analysis, time-series, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
On a more personal level, I enjoy the Python programming language,
the emacs text editor, board and video games, and vegetarian food.
